# Empirical-Study-of-Soybean-Seed-Selection
As the world's population increases, scientific seed selection becomes more and more important in agricultural industry. A scientific seed selection process should not only be based on characteristics of seeds, but also the specific weather conditions, soil types and irrigation conditions of farms. Although most of the farmers would take above-mentioned factors into consideration, their decisions depend more on experience than data, which may not be precise enough to achieve higher yield, higher efficiency and lower risks. Thus, this paper will take soybean as an example to provide a machine learning-based method to help improve the seed selection process. In this paper, we mainly try to select and recommend a portfolio that only contains 5 types of soybean seeds among 182 varieties for a given target farm, so as to improve the mean yield and reduce the risk for the target farm. We use the soybean seeds data from 2003 to 2011 collected by Syngenta R&D, weather data from 2003 to 2009 collected by ECMWF as well as soil data collected by CONUS and ISRIC as our dataset, then we compare several widely used machine learning methods, including LASSO, regression tree, random forest, bagging, boosting, etc.based on their mean test MSE, and choose a best model among them to predict mean yield and variance for each soybean seed variety in the target farm under different possible weather conditions. Based on the prediction results, we finally recommend to the target farm a seed portfolio that contains 5 soybean varieties in order to lower its risk while improve the mean yield.

PART1-Descriptive Analysis: Used K-Means Clustering to classify all the farms into 25 clusters, and performed descriptive analysis using R to demonstrate features of soybean seeds, farm locations, and weather conditions of each cluster, and drew pie chart, histogram, etc.to show the features

PART2-Predictive Analysis: Built multiple machine learning models, including LASSO, Random Forest, Bagged Tree, and Boosted Tree, and chose best one based on test MSE to predict yield for each type of soybean seed under various weather conditions

PART3-Prescriptive Analysis: Recommended 5 types of soybean seeds with higher mean yield and lower variance under diverse weather, soil types, radiation, and precipitation conditions for the target farm to help it gain higher and more stable yields
